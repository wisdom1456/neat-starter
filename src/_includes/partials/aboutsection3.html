                Stephen M. Bernhardt has been practicing law since 2010 and has
                experience in both criminal and civil law. His legal career
                began at the State Attorney’s Office where he was a prosecutor
                for several years. Bernhardt prosecuted multiple trials
                resulting in prison sentences of more than ten years, including
                a trial that resulted in a guilty verdict and a mandatory
                life-in-prison sentence.<br/><br/>
                After leaving the State Attorney’s Office, Bernhardt began
                practicing civil law for one of the largest creditors’ rights
                firms in the United States. He quickly became the lead litigator
                for the firm’s Florida office and handled countless civil
                hearings and trials.<br/><br/>
                Ultimately, Bernhardt started his own practice. Using the
                knowledge Stephen has gained throughout the last decade,
                Bernhardt Law maintains a sharp focus and dedication to ensuring
                each client’s specific situation is handled with the utmost
                professionalism, attention to detail, and integrity.
