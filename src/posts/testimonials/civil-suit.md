I hired Mrs. Riley to represent me against a termite company for damages that occurred to my home during my contract with them. Athena was always very thorough, very professional and always kept me in the loop. She was aggressive, but it a great way, when dealing with them, as to what would be an acceptable outcome for me. I truly believe she has/had my very best interest at heart. If i ever need legal help again, she will be the first person i contact!
