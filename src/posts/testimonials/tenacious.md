Athena was tenacious during trial. I felt the defendants didn't have a chance. It was difficult because the defendants didn't have An attorney, which created more work for Athena and more expense to me. Athena took me on as a client to continue my brother's case after he passed away. She trusted me, saw it through, and was Victorious in getting justice for my brother. Thank you, Athena!
