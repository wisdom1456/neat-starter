Collection companies are governed by strict rules and regulations. These regulations are intended to protect consumers from deceptive and harassing collection efforts.

Violations may occur if collection companies:

* **Contacted you after you requested not to be contacted**
* **Contacted you in a manner in which you have requested not to be contacted. For example, you ask the collection company to only contact you by writing, and they call you**
* **Threaten you in any manner whatsoever**
* **Insult you**
* **Imply that there is a possibility you could go to jail if the debt is not paid**
* **Call you late at night or early in the morning**
* **Call your work, or other individuals you know, and disclose the reason for the call**
* **Misrepresent the amount or nature of the debt**
* **Call you after you have hired an attorney**

There are many other ways collection companies violate federal or state acts put in place to protect consumers. **[Call us](http://blflorida.kallistoart.net/contact-us)** today if you are being harassed by a collection company.
