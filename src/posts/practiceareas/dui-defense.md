A DUI conviction in Florida comes with serious penalties compared to other states. However, a DUI is not always an easy offense for the prosecution to prove. In fact, there are many potential defenses inherent in any DUI case.

Having prosecuted countless DUIs for the State Attorney’s Office, Stephen M. Bernhardt has the knowledge and expertise to prepare the best defense for your case.

If you have been arrested for DUI in Pinellas, Hillsborough or Pasco Counties, your best defense is with Bernhardt Riley.

**Your Driver License**

You must demand a Formal Administrative Review Hearing within 10 days of your arrest to challenge your driver’s license suspension following a DUI.

If this is your first DUI arrest, you may be able to immediately apply for a hardship license. 

Bernhardt Riley will act quickly to help get your license reinstated.

**What State Must Prove**

1. The Defendant drove (or was in actual physical control of) a vehicle.
2. While driving the vehicle, The Defendant either:
3. Was under the influence of alcoholic beverages or a chemical/controlled substance to the extent that his/her normal faculties were impaired
