The Florida legislature enacted the Florida Construction Lien Law in order to protect the rights of all parties to the construction process, including owners, contractors, and subcontractors.
Bernhardt Riley helps to draft and interpret of all forms contemplated by the Florida Construction Lien Law, including:

-   Notices of Commencement
-   Notices to Owner
-   Sworn Statements of Account
-   Lien Releases
-   Payment Bonds
-   Claims of Lien

All parties to a lien claim must understand that any failure to meet the requirements of the Florida Construction Lien Law will potentially defeat a lien claim. Thus, it is imperative that all forms
be completed with attention to detail, referencing the legal description and address of the property at issue, and the exact amount of the lien claimed. Mistakes or omissions in the address, legal
description, the basis for the claim, signatures, notarizations, and/or the exact amount owed on the claim can all jeopardize the claim for either party. No matter which side of the action you find
yourself on, the construction litigation Bernhardt Riley attorneys are here to help.
