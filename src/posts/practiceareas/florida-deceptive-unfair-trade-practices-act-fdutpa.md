**Florida Deceptive Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA)**

The Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA) as found in Florida Statutes 501.201-501.213 protects consumers and competing businesses from anyone who engages in unfair methods of
competition or deceptive practice in any trade or commerce. Such trades may include

-   Automotive Sales and Service Centers
-   Exterminators
-   Sellers of Travel Packages
-   Resellers of Timeshares
-   Sellers and Installers of Flooring
-   Sellers of Prepaid Calling Cards
-   For-Profit Schools
-   Data Security Firms

False and misleading tactics from these industries may be designed to trick a customer into paying more for goods and services than was advertised, or into paying for goods and services that they
never received.

FDUTPA was designed to encompass a broad spectrum of deceptive and unfair conduct such as the following

-   “Bait And Switch” or Other False or Misleading Advertising
-   Misrepresenting Used Goods as New
-   Falsely Claiming that a Vehicle or Product is in Need of Repair or Replacement
-   Slipping Improper or Undisclosed Fees into a Bill or Contract
-   Adding Unauthorized Charges onto A Phone Bill
-   Delivering Goods that were not Ordered and Billing unless the Customer Declines
-   Price Gouging After a Hurricane, Flood or During a State Of Emergency
-   Salespeople Misrepresenting their Authority to Negotiate Terms or Close a Sale

The statute of limitation for bringing a FDUTPA claim is four (4) years from the date of the event giving rise to the FDUTPA claim.  If you believe that there has been a violation of FDUTPA, contact
the trial attorneys at Bernhardt Riley to help evaluate your potential claim.
