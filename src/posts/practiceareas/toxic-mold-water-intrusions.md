**Toxic Mold**

Water intrusions, busted water pipes, roofing damages, defective construction and even faulty dehumidifiers can all lead to the occurrence of toxic mold from excessive moisture in your home. The resulting toxic mold can ruin drywall, and trigger health problems. “Toxic mold” refers to molds that produce mycotoxins which are naturally occurring toxins produced by certain molds (fungi). Exposure to high levels of these mycotoxins have been known to lead to serious illnesses. Toxic mold is more hazardous than typical mold or mildew growth due to the mycotoxins produced by the mold. Keep in mind that while mold is usually black or green in color, it is usually only identifiable by trained professionals.

There are generally two forms of toxic mold claims: 1) Damage to your property that has been caused by toxic mold or 2) Personal injuries due to toxic mold exposure.  

 

**Water Intrusions**

Water intrusions can result in catastrophic damages to your home or business, and result when unwanted or undesired water or moisture leaks into your home and results in structural issues, wall damage, and damages to property foundations. Your homeowner’s insurance may be responsible to pay for the cleanup of the water intrusion, the physical damage to your home and any resulting mold problems and the homeowner may be entitled to damages for personal injuries that result from mold exposure, including illness or aggravation of an existing illness. These damages may include 1) the cost to remediate the mold 2) any medical care resulting from the mold 3) lost wages 4) replacement cost value of the damaged personal property due to mold and 5) pain and suffering.

If you are a tenant who has suffered from exposure to toxic mold in a rented condominium, apartment, or house, and if  you have renter’s insurance, the insurance company may be responsible for the cleanup of the water damage, mold, and any damage to the your personal property and furniture, and may also be responsible for damage for personal injuries caused by the toxic mold.
