Whether you are forming a new business, running a small company, or are the CEO of a large corporation, we focus on finding proactive legal solutions that make achieving your business goals possible.

-   **Business formation –** Whether you have just decided to start your own business, or have had a long standing business with several partners, Bernhardt Riley’s business attorneys can help to
    navigate you from beginning to end.
-   **Business contracts –** Before you agree to sign any type of business or partnership agreement, there are a number of items that are important to ensure that what you are signing is not only
    lawful and enforceable, but is fair. The business attorneys at Bernhardt Riley can review your legal contracts to verify that your interests are protected.
-   **Business litigation –** Whether you have discovered that your business partner is fraudulently using or misappropriating business profits for personal gain, or you have been accused of the same,
    you want aggressive and experienced trial attorneys to represent you every step of the way. Bernhardt Riley’s litigation attorneys are here to help.
-   **Business succession –** Businesses can be fluid entities, often going through various stages of growth and present unique challenges. A business succession plan will address what happens to your
    business in the event of an untimely death, how to transfer your business to a new owner, and how to officially retire from your business. Bernhardt Riley’s business attorneys will help you
    prepare for all stages of your business with confidence.
