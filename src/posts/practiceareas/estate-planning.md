Planning and preparation are important elements of ensuring a successful financial future for your family. Creating an estate plan, drafting a will, and setting up a revocable living trust in advanced will ensure that you and your family are prepared to receive the care you deserve.

1. Durable Power of Attorney: A durable power of attorney (DPOA) remains effective even if a person becomes incapacitated. In order to be effective, the DPOA must be signed by the principal and by two witnesses and be notarized. Keep in mind that as a DPOA you are an agent, which is a fiduciary of the principal. You are responsible for acting in good faith, preserving the principal’s estate plan, and may not delegate authority to a third party. Under Florida law, multiple agents are presumed to be capable of acting independently. An agent must also keep records of all receipts, disbursements, and transactions made on behalf of the principal.
2. A Healthcare Directive: A Healthcare Directive is  a package of documents (Combination Living Will, Healthcare Surrogate and HIPPA Release) intended to cover an individual’s medical decisions and wishes for medical treatment should that person  no longer be able to make those decisions for themself, i.e. in the event of incapacity. These documents are also known by a number of other names, including a “Florida Medical Directive” or “Florida Advance Directive” or “Florida Advance Medical Directive” or “Do Not Resuscitate” or “Medical Power of Attorney”.

    

**Components of the Healthcare Directive**

1. **The Living Will** – A Florida Living Will is an oral or written statement that expresses the kinds of treatment options that is wanted in the event that person is no longer able to decide for themself.  The living will often function as a “*do not resuscitate*” in dire medical circumstances.

    
2. **Designation of Healthcare Surrogate** – Also known as a “Healthcare Power of Attorney”, the purpose of this document is to designate the person(s) who is empowered to enforce the medical wishes as expressed in the living will.
3. **HIPPA Release –** Since federal law protects the privacy of individuals concerning their medical records, a HIPAA release document is required to release medical records to third parties, including family members. Under Florida law, a HIPAA authorization cannot be effective for more than 24 months, so the HIPPA release will need to be updated at that time.
