There are multiple legal defenses that commonly arise in theft-related charges. The State’s theft cases are routinely built around circumstantial evidence only, with no hard evidence. In other instances, evidence was improperly obtained, resulting in its exclusion from court proceedings.

**Florida Statute [812.014](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0800-0899/0812/Sections/0812.014.html) – Theft:**

A person commits theft if he or she knowingly obtains or uses, or endeavors to obtain or to use, the property of another with intent to, either temporarily or permanently: (1)

Deprive the other person of a right to the property or a benefit from the property. (a)

Appropriate the property to his or her own use or to the use of any person not entitled to the use of the property. (b)

The potential sentences can range dramatically depending on the value of the alleged stolen items. While the theft statute and sentencing statutes provide many nuances to the degree of the crime and the potential sentences, a very basic guideline is included below.
