Possession charges can be defended in many ways. Some common defenses include knowledge of the presence of the narcotics, dominion and control over the narcotics and the State’s ability to prove the substance is a prohibited substance.  Additionally, law enforcement often discovers the narcotics from an unlawful vantage point or fails to properly obtain and/or execute a search warrant.  The best criminal defense attorneys review all these scenarios and more in a swift and thorough manner.

Don’t accept a plea agreement with the State until your case is thoroughly reviewed by an experienced attorney!

**Possession of a Controlled Substance** – **[Florida Statute 893.13(6)(a)](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0800-0899/0893/Sections/0893.13.html)**

Unless the controlled substance was lawfully obtained, a person may not be in actual or constructive possession of a “controlled substance.”

Common controlled substances include cocaine, heroin, hydrocodone, oxycodone, opium, methamphetamine, codeine, fentanyl and many others.

Controlled substances found within the following sections constitute a second degree felony and is punishable up to *fifteen (15) years in prison*: F.S. 893.03(1)(a), (1)(b), (1)(d), (2)(a), (2)(b), or (2)(c)5.

Controlled substances found within the following sections constitute a third degree felony and is punishable up to *five (5) years in prison*: F.S. 893.03(1)(c), (2)(c)1., (2)(c)2., (2)(c)3., (2)(c)6., (2)(c)7., (2)(c)8., (2)(c)9., (2)(c)10., (3), or (4).

**Possession of Marijuana – [Florida Statute 893.13(6)(b)](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0800-0899/0893/Sections/0893.13.html)**

The legal landscape is constantly shifting in its enforcement of marijuana laws.  If you or a loved one has been arrested for a marijuana-related crime and you want more information, contact Bernhardt Law.

**Sale of Controlled Substance –** [Florida Statute 893.13(1)(A)](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0800-0899/0893/Sections/0893.13.html)

Generally, a person may not sell, manufacture, deliver (or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver), a controlled substance.

A person who violates this provision could receive a wide range of possible sentences, depending on the controlled substance. These sentences are enhanced if contraband is sold too close to certain locations, such as schools and parks; or illegal transactions occur at certain times of day.

**Trafficking Drugs – [Florida Statute 893.135](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/STATUTES/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0800-0899/0893/Sections/0893.135.html)**

In Florida, you may be charged with Trafficking a Controlled Substance e*ven* if you had *no intent to sell* or deliver the substance. The State only has to prove that you possessed a certain weight of the substance. If sentenced under the Trafficking statute, the sentence *must* include a prison sentence ranging from three (3) to twenty-five (25) years. The judge will have no authority to depart from the mandatory prison sentence.

**HELP TO FIGHT AN ADDICTION**

At times, helping someone with a criminal case is larger than trying to get the State to drop or reduce the charges. At Bernhardt Law, we emphasize helping those who desire to overcome addiction while thoroughly defending their rights.

Of course, your case would still be reviewed for any and all potential legal defenses. But in addition to legally defending your case, Bernhardt Law specifically puts an emphasis on helping people fight addiction.

Stephen Bernhardt brings extensive experience as a *former State representative of the Drug Court Program*.

The State Attorney’s Office lacks the time to make every person an offer that is unique to their individual situation. Thus, many people end up with a sentence that is actually harmful to their recovery attempts.

This applies to all kinds of cases, not just possession charges.  Far too often, a theft or battery is a by-product of an addiction to drugs or alcohol.

Seemingly arbitrary jail sentences and one-size-fits-all probation sentences can have the effect of making recovery more difficult or set one up to fail.

Whatever your situation, Bernhardt Law works to protect your rights and improve the future of every client.
