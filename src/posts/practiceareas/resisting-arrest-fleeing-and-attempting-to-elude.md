Resisting an officer – with or without violence – is a common arrest, especially to those not originally the subject of the original investigation.

Arrests for these offenses commonly arise when a third party is simply trying to protect a friend or family member.

Law Enforcement Officers do have a dangerous job, and they obviously like to keep everything under control. Thus, arrests for “resisting” or “obstruction” are regularly made quickly in an attempt to
control the situation.

With that said, many defenses often exist.

Under most circumstances, if the client wishes, Bernhardt Riley will conduct a *free consultation at the scene of the crime*. Not only is this usually a convenient location for the client, but it is
especially helpful in a “Resisting” case, because it aids in fully understanding the surroundings for an early start preparing a defense.

Fleeing and Attempting to Elude a Law Enforcement Officer has several degrees and levels of severity, many of which carry higher punishments than one might expect. This is another example of where Law
Enforcement Officers commonly overcharge.

It is important to speak to an experienced attorney about this offense before entering into any plea agreement. Contact Bernhardt Riley for a FREE evaluation of your case.
