Unfortunately, most of us will be involved in an automobile accident during our lives. If it happens to you, there are important things that you should know to ensure you receive the full compensation
you may deserve.

1. **If you don’t need to be rushed to the ER, contact the police and gather as much information from the scene as possible:**

-   -   The names, phone numbers, addresses, license plate numbers, and insurance information from the others involved in the accident
    -   The names, phone numbers and addresses of anyone who witnessed the accident
    -   Photos of damage to the vehicles involved; skid marks; or anything else that you believe may be important

2. **Take notes about the conditions of the road and the weather that day**
3. **Make notes of your injuries immediately after the accident, and continue charting how your injuries progress over the next several hours and days**
4. **Remember to seek medical attention within 14 days of the accident. If you fail to do so, it is likely that your insurer will deny your claim. It is common for accident victims to have injuries
   that take days or even weeks to develop, so it is recommended that you seek treatment as soon as possible after the accident**
