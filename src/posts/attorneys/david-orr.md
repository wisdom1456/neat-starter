  <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">David Orr began his legal career practicing civil law for one of the largest creditors’ rights firms in the United States, after graduating from Stetson University College of Law as a full Dean’s Merit Scholarship recipient. In David’s role representing debt collectors, large national banks, and various other creditors, he learned the ways that creditors target debtors and the ways in which they can fail to prove their cases. David eventually became the lead litigator in the office, and personally tried over one hundred trials, among countless other dispositive motions, depositions, and other hearings. Through this extensive experience, David is well-versed in all matters related to defending debtors.</p>
