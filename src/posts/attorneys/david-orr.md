“David Orr began his legal career practicing civil law for one of the largest creditors’ rights firms in the United States, after graduating from Stetson University College of Law as a full Dean’s Merit Scholarship recipient. In David’s role representing debt collectors, large national banks, and various other creditors, he learned the ways that creditors target debtors and the ways in which they can fail to prove their cases. David eventually became the lead litigator in the office, and personally tried over one hundred trials, among countless other dispositive motions, depositions, and other hearings. Through this extensive experience, David is well-versed in all matters related to defending debtors.

 

Prior to joining Bernhardt Law, PLLC, David also spent time working for two of the largest insurance defense firms in the nation, specializing in auto-accident, personal injury, first-party property, premises liability, and other insurance related matters. In this capacity, David gained invaluable experience dealing with complex litigation and was able to greatly expand his areas of practice. David is now ready to bring his knowledge and experience to Bernhardt Law PLLC, where he will further the firm’s dedication to serving our clients with the highest degree of professionalism and a meticulous approach to all aspects of our client’s cases.”
