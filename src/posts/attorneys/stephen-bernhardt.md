He began his legal career as a prosecutor, first handling misdemeanor offenses such as DUI, Battery, Possession of a Controlled Substance, Violation of Injunction and many others. Stephen quickly escalated to a felony division and became senior attorney in his division. As such, Stephen conducted many trials involving high-level crimes. Stephen won multiple jury trials that resulted in prison sentences of more than 25 years, including one life sentence.
